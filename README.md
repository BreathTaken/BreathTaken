Code should be fun as well as efficient. As Einstein would say, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Or so has been quoted.. Well, in my own philosophy, I've come to something of a motto but also certainly not a fact: If it's not fun, then you don't know it well enough to make it so.

p.s. You're welcome to immortalize me in some quotes too
